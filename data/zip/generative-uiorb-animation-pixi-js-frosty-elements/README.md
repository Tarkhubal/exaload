# Generative UI - Orb Animation [pixi.js] + Frosty Elements ‚ùÑÔ∏è

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/georgedoescode/pen/XWNmvro](https://codepen.io/georgedoescode/pen/XWNmvro).

This is the final code example for my upcoming tutorial on creating a generative UI with a super zen orbs animation (built with pixi.js) and a nice frosty UI. 

The colors here are generative too!
